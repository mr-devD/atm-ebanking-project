# atm-ebanking-project

This is the first project I did on faculty, 3 years ago. In that time, I still haven't learned OOP, so everything is kind of messy. The idea of project was to create ATM but in the time I was creating it, I got idea of adding few thing so it is more like an E-banking app. You can send money, deposit, withdraw, exchange currencies, open accounts. Register with password/email validity check and receiving welcome email(which won't work because smtp is not set). Password change feature.  Loan taking etc.
